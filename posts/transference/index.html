<h2 id="fading">Fading</h2>
<p><em>2021, Screenprint on button-up shirts, Dimensions vary</em></p>
<p>In <em><strong>Fading</strong></em>, ink ingrains the surface of button-up shirts, the legibility of the transfer fading in and out based on the applied pressure and the give of the fiber blends. The quoted material and borrowed imagery are taken out of their original context and distorted through the repeated application of the screen printing process. Through the repeated application, an imperfect impression undulates the surface and exists in a state between a texture and as a readable content.</p>
<p>The image of the cow, the breeding diagram, and illustrated cattle chute coalesce into a narrative that places the text into a context of the cow industry, which is reinforced by the quotes that relate to specific practices for beef cattle and maintaining one’s own herd.</p>
<p>Through the shirt placement on the standing coat rack, <em><strong>Fading</strong></em> is meant to reference the taking off of a work shirt at the end of the day and the shedding of the related responsibilities before donning the shirt the next day.</p>

<h2 id="fluctuation">Fluctuation</h2>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A hemispherical vessel, which is usually bigger than a cup. Concave. A hollowed, curved interior. Parts of a bowl: the foot, the waist, the body, the rim, and the bottom of the bowl.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/transference/fluctuation_detail_hand2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When learning how to woodturn, bowls are a typical starting point as they allow for an individual how to correctly use the carving tools, such as the bowl scraper and ball gouge. Due to the different sizing and design choices, visibly noted in the waist and body portion of the bowls, a person’s interaction with the surface differs due to the placement of the beads (rounded, raised profiles) and the coves (concave depressions). The bowl blanks, a cylindrical piece of wood set for turning, provide a sense of the interior grain; however, through the shaping, the emergence of knots create a difference in texture. As material is removed, the moisture content decreases, and the changing humidity and temperature levels can lead to checking, or the separation of the wood fibers (e.g. splitting).</p>
<p>However, as wood has the ability to retain and to lose moisture, its surface is often in a state of expansion and contraction, and in this manner, it continues to fluctuate even when not existing as a live surface.</p>

<h2 id="in-transitus">In Transitus</h2>
<p><em>2021, Reclaimed wood and screws, 28 x 36 x 19.5 in</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In Transitus</strong></em> began as the flooring of a horse trailer, an area of containment and transportation. As a table, the wood acts as an area of contemplation, a starting point, and an endpoint. As ideas circulate in a transitional space, an actualization is able to occur through repeated actions, and the space acts as a place of display.</p>
<p>Originally, the wood no longer held a specific function, and as discarded materials, the boards were slowly deteriorating and acting as a surface for mold, moss, and rot. Using the boards to create a table allowed for this previous history to be attached but also allowed for it to be repurposed and resituated as a different and functional item.</p>
<p>One side of the table showcases a mechanical edge. Through the clean cuts of the material made by a miter saw, the newly exposed material reveals the stability that is hidden by its exterior. This contrasts with the organic, decaying line created by the fragmentation of its existing history. On the underside of the table, a distorted branding showcases information of an original sale point or lumber company as an above-ground plank.</p>

<h2 id="parting--dispersal">Parting &amp; Dispersal</h2>
<p><em>2021, Plywood, kona stain, shellac, and carbon transfer, 4 x 4 x 4 in</em></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To praise or celebrate : hymn | A hymn is a stanzaic song or poem often created with the intent to praise a god or deity. Typically containing religious overtones, devotional songs coincide with hymns in their purpose of adoration or prayer towards a godly figure.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Every Wednesday and Sunday, from age 8-10, I would go with my Grannie and PawPaw to a local church. After my family moved, I would go from Baptist to Methodist churches; the singing of hymnals being a central activity and a beginning of my love for choir singing. In the church setting, an emphasis was not placed on pitch and instead on the devotion portrayed through singing and a sense of unity.</p>
<p>Through a process of transferring the hymnals via carbon paper, through pressured-tracing, the echoes of a hymnal are passed onto the surface of the plywood at varying degrees of opacity. These echoes reference both the continued history and use of hymnals. Each of the transferred hymns contain messages centered on sorrow and parting.</p>

<h2 id="revolving">Revolving</h2>
<p><em>2021, Reclaimed wood, pine planks, and pine door, 96 x 120 x 4 in</em></p>
<p>As defining features of a space, a wall and door act as a revolving place of entry and exit, or more specifically as a boundary or a place of welcoming. In the houses of my childhood, the walls showcased their age through the sagging, creaking, and groaning of the boards; the aging of their exterior; and their ability to encapsulate a history of gatherings and the lifetimes of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>The wall boarding in <em><strong>Revolving</strong></em> originates from old fencing and pine planks provided by family. The fencing had been replaced by new material, and the old planks were no longer structurally sound enough to maintain their intended barrier.</p>
<p>The door was found after a week of heavy rain in a Columbus neighborhood; fungus, orange mushrooms, and other bodies were growing exponentially upon its decaying surface. Paired with the fencing, the door creates an imitation of an exterior or interior surface found among old Southern houses.</p>

<h2 id="rise-and-fall">Rise and Fall</h2>
<p><em>2021, Cherry tree</em></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stool /sto͞ol/ a stump of a tree that can produce suckers or shoots; suckers are a tree’s attempt to revive itself as new branches generate from the stump. In relation to a chair, a stool refers to a seat that typically does not have features like an armrest or backing but is still supported by legs. Depending on the height of the legs and the amount of back support, a chair has an ability to impact the body in a positive or negative manner.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>A stool is a place of rest, requiring the sitter to rise and fall as there are no surrounding supports in the form of a backing or armrests. Inspired by an unstable stool I created through green woodworking, <em><strong>Rise and Fall</strong></em> is my second attempt at creating a stool.</p>
<p>The leaves of cherry trees are toxic to grazing mammals, such as cows, horses, goats, and mules. Prior to selling her heifer and calf, my mom cut down a majority of the cherry trees on her acreage. The stool is made from sections of one of the cut cherry trees with the seat being a cookie, or cross-section of the tree, and the legs being vertically split portions. After the removal of the bark and sanding, the seat retained some of its original shape. This contrasts with the stool legs which were shaped on a lathe.</p>

<h2 id="stasis-blooming--wilting">Stasis: Blooming &amp; Wilting</h2>
<p><em>2021, 14 gauge steel, quarter-inch rods, 5/16-inch rods, cedar wood, Dimensions vary</em></p>
<p>As epiphytes, orchids (scientific name Orchidaceae) grow on trees in tropical climates. With over 880 different genera, or types, and over 22,000 species, the orchidaceae family is the second largest of the flowering plants with its various blooms and colorations; each genera often requiring different care methods (e.g. watering, temperatures, potting). In stores, one of the major genuses of orchids available is the Phalaenopsis blume, or the moth orchid.</p>
<p>Fragility and strength are held in duality in <em><strong>Stasis: Blooming &amp; Wilting</strong></em>. Held in an eternal state of growth and deterioration, one is able to observe the life cycle of an orchid. The orchid holds a familial significance as it was a plant my family would give to my late Grannie. The orchid’s beautiful bloom provided visual beauty during a time of difficulty. For me, the plant became a symbol of the familial relation and also of the frailty of maintaining.</p>
<p>While maintaining a phototropic and geotropic response akin to what I have associated with store bought orchids, the metal plant attempts to echo an organic form while slowly encasing increasingly larger tree sections. Initially dependent on the support of other structures, the orchid in displaying final stages of its life cycle is free standing, having entirely framed the organic structure.</p>

<h2 id="tempering">Tempering</h2>
<p><em>2021, 14 gauge steel, 6 in (each comb)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tempering</strong></em> explores the relation of form and function. Combs are recognized through their structure of a handle and a singular row of teeth. The Idea of a comb creates many possibilities: all- purpose comb, fine-tooth comb, barber comb, pick comb, pin tail comb, hot comb, pocket comb, rake comb, rat tail comb, teasing comb, wide-tooth comb. Its typical features provide a baseline for differing associations and/or uses which have been adapted based on need.</p>
<p><img src="/images/transference/tempering_installcopy.jpeg" alt="">
<img src="/images/transference/tempering_detail2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Based on a comb procured from a 2-in-1 comb-and-mirror set at a thrift store, its form was simplified and underwent a series of changes to create an Idea of a functional object. The form was then repeatedly cut on 14 gauge steel using a CNC machine and manipulated through hammering. Each form differs in its end result and requires different hand positions to continue its assumed function.</p>
<p>For me, combs hold an association of: the yearly checks by the school nurse for lice, my mom detangling the knots caused by an open truck window, sporadic trips to the walk-in hair salons for inch trims, and when I gave my mom a haircut during the pandemic and cutting a straight line seemed impossible.</p>
