Patchwork Recollections focuses on the connection between the storytelling of quilts and the stories told by objects. The project explores the narratives of Georgia and Alabama natives, while examining the cultural history of quilting in the Columbus area and the Chattahoochee River. Patchwork Recollections is inspired by the Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers, a community comprised of African American Women.
